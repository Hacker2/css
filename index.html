      <div style="text-align:justify">The user agent—and not CSS, at least as of late 2017—determines how justified text
should be stretched to fill the space between the left and right edges of the parent.
Some browsers, for example, might add extra space only between words, while others
might distribute the extra space between letters (although the CSS specification states
that “user agents may not further increase or decrease the inter-character space” if the
property letter-spacing has been assigned a length value). Other user agents may
reduce space on some lines, thus mashing the text together a bit more than usual. All
of these possibilities will affect the appearance of an element, and may even change its
height, depending on how many lines of text result from the user agent’s justification
choices.</div>
