<div id="brinza-task-description">
<p>Ellen is a new Assembly Line Manager in a shoe factory. So far, everything has been going very smoothly for her and N shoes of the same model and size have been produced. Exactly half of them are left shoes and the other half are right shoes.</p>
<p>The freshly sewn shoes are standing in a line, in no particular order (i.e. with no regard to being left or right shoes). They now need to be matched into pairs and packed into boxes.</p>
<p>Ellen would like to assign this task to her subordinate workers. Each worker should get a distinct interval of adjacent shoes, such that the number of left shoes is equal to the number of right shoes. Each shoe must be assigned to exactly one worker.</p>
<p>What is the maximum number of workers that Ellen can assign to this task?</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>class Solution { public int solution(String S); }</tt></p></blockquote>
<p>that, given a string S of letters "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">L</tt>" and "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">R</tt>", denoting the types of shoes in line (left or right), returns the maximum number of intervals such that each interval contains an equal number of left and right shoes.</p>
<p>For example, given S = "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RLRRLLRLRRLL</tt>", the function should return 4, because S can be split into intervals: "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RL</tt>", "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RRLL</tt>", "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RL</tt>" and "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RRLL</tt>". Note that the intervals do not have to be of the same size.</p>
<p>Given S = "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RLLLRRRLLR</tt>", the function should return 4, because S can be split into intervals: "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RL</tt>", "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">LLRR</tt>", "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">RL</tt>" and "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">LR</tt>".</p>
<p>Given S = "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">LLRLRLRLRLRLRR</tt>", the function should return 1.</p>
<p>Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
<blockquote><ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">2</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
<li>string S consists only of the characters "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">R</tt>" and/or "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">L</tt>";</li>
<li>the number of letters "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">L</tt>" and "<tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">R</tt>" in string <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">S</tt> is the same.</li>
</ul>
