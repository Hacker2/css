One of the first interesting things to notice about floated elements is that margins
around floated elements do not collapse. If you float an image with 20-pixel margins,
<div style="float: right;margin: 5px;">float right</div>there will be at least 20 pixels of space around that image. If other elements adjacent
to the image—and that means adjacent horizontally and vertically—also have margins,
those margins will not collapse with the margins on the floated image, as you
<img src="css.png" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; float: right;margin-top: -60px;border: 5px solid green;">
can see in Figure 10-3:
